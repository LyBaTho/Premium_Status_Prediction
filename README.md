# Premium_Status_Prediction
Predicting Premium Status Using Python Classification Algorithms

This research project focuses on the development of an accurate premium status prediction model using Python. The study incorporates several techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), comprehensive data preprocessing (including cleaning, data standardizing, data transformation, feature engineering, and data splitting), and the application of different machine learning algorithms to assess the model's predictive performance.

The prediction model considers a set of carefully selected variables, namely 'application_underwriting_score', 'residence_area', 'sourcing_channel','perc_premium_paid_by_cash_credit', 'income','no_of_premiums_paid', 'premium','age', 'total_late_payments' and 'target'. These variables are pivotal in evaluating the risk and likelihood of successful loan repayment.

The experimental results demonstrate a promising prediction accuracy of approximately 95% in premium status classification.
